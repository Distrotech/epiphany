{"name":"Epiphany","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/epiphany","body":"Epiphany is a GNOME web browser based on the WebKit rendering engine.\r\nThe name meaning:\r\n\"An intuitive grasp of reality through\r\nsomething (as an event) usually simple and striking\"\r\n\r\nMANIFESTO\r\n\r\nA web browser is more than an application, it is a way of thinking, it is\r\na way of seeing the world. Epiphany's principles are simplicity and standards\r\ncompliance.\r\n\r\nSimplicity:\r\n\r\nEpiphany aims to utilize the simplest interface possible for a browser.  Keep\r\nin mind that simple does not necessarily mean less powerful.  We believe\r\nthe commonly used browsers of today are too big, buggy, and bloated. Epiphany\r\naddresses simplicity with a small browser designed for the web -- not mail,\r\nnewsgroups, file management, instant messenging or coffee making.  The UNIX\r\nphilosophy is to design small tools that do one thing, and do it well.\r\n\r\nEpiphany also address simplicity with modularity to make a light and powerful\r\napplication.  If something can be implemented using external applications\r\nor components, we use it rather than wasting resources in the web browser.\r\nIntegration with other desktop applications can also be achieved using DBus\r\nand the ever popular command line.\r\n\r\nOther tasks like mail can be handled with your favorite e-mail application\r\n(Evolution, pine, mutt, balsa, pronto, whatever).\r\n\r\nStandards compliance:\r\n\r\nThe introduction of non-standard features in browsers could make it difficult\r\nor impossible to use alternative products like Epiphany if developers embrace\r\nthem. Alternative (standards complying) browsers could not be able to\r\nfully access web sites making use of these features.  The success of\r\nnon-standard features can ultimately lead to forcing one browser, on\r\none platform to dominate the market.\r\n\r\nStandards compliance ensures the freedom of choice.  Epiphany aims to achieve\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nUSER INTERFACE LINES\r\n\r\n- HIG compliance\r\n\r\nEpiphany is going to follow latest version of the GNOME Human Interface\r\nGuidelines. Unless there are very serious reasons to make an exception not\r\nfollowing it will be considered a bug.\r\n\"I follow the HIG only when I like it\" is not a legitimate approach.\r\nAny areas where we diverge from the HIG will communicated\r\nto the HIG team for future consideration.\r\n\r\n- GNOME integration\r\n\r\nEpiphany's main goal is to be integrated with the GNOME desktop.\r\nWe dont aim to make epiphany usable outside GNOME. If someone will like\r\nto use it anyway, it's just a plus. Ex: Making people happy that\r\ndon't have control center installed is not a good reason\r\nto have mime configuration in epiphany itself.\r\n\r\n- Simple design\r\n\r\nFeature bloat and user interface clutter is evil :)\r\n\r\n- Preferences\r\n\r\nWe will follow the new GNOME policy about preferences.\r\nI think Havoc Pennington already explained it a lot\r\nbetter than I could ever do.\r\nhttp://www106.pair.com/rhp/free-software-ui.html\r\n\r\n- User target\r\n\r\nWe target non-technical users by design.\r\nThis happens to be 90% of the user population.\r\n(Technical details should not exposed in the interface)\r\nWe target web users, we dont directly target web developers.\r\nA few geek-oriented feautures can be kept as\r\nlong as they are non-obtrusive.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nYou will need a complete installation of GNOME 2.x desktop.\r\nThe required WebKit version will be specified in the release notes.\r\n\r\nHOW TO HELP\r\n\r\nYou can report new bugs at\r\n http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=epiphany\r\nAnd feel free to send patches.\r\n\r\nAbout new feautures I'll just quote Metacity FAQ.\r\n\r\nQ: Will you add my feature?\r\n\r\nA: If it makes sense to turn on unconditionally,\r\n   or is genuinely a harmless preference that I would not\r\n   be embarrassed to put in a simple, uncluttered, user-friendly\r\n   configuration dialog.\r\n\r\n   If the only rationale for your feature is that other\r\n   [browsers] have it, or that you are personally used to it, or something\r\n   like that, then I will not be impressed. [Epiphany] is firmly in the\r\n   \"choose good defaults\" camp rather than the \"offer 6 equally broken\r\n   ways to do it, and let the user pick one\" camp.\r\n\r\n   Don't let this discourage patches and fixes - I love those. ;-)\r\n   Just be prepared to hear the above objections if your patch\r\n   adds some crack-ridden configuration option.\r\n\r\nCONTACTS\r\n\r\nEpiphany Mailing List <epiphany-list@gnome.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
